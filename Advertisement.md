### Why Tracking Physiological Metrics Matters

Measuring stress levels, heart rate variability (HRV), and heart rate during meditation and breathwork provides valuable insights into their effectiveness.
* Stress Levels: Real-time stress tracking can help assess how meditation and breathwork reduce physiological tension over time.
* Heart Rate Variability (HRV): A higher HRV is linked to better autonomic nervous system balance, meaning improved resilience to stress. Slow, deep breathing and mindfulness practices can enhance HRV, reflecting better relaxation and recovery.
* Heart Rate: Meditation typically lowers heart rate over time, while breathwork may cause temporary fluctuations depending on the technique used. Tracking heart rate can reveal patterns in how the body responds to different practices.!
