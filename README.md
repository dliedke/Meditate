  - pNN20 - % of successive beat-to-beat intervals that differ by more than 20 ms
  - pNN50 - % of successive beat-to-beat intervals that differ by more than 50 ms
  - beat-to-beat interval - reading coming directly from the watch sensor
  - HRV Successive Differences - difference between the current and previous beat-to-beat intervals
  - SDRR - [Standard Deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of beat-to-beat intervals
    - calculated from the first and last 5 min of the session
  - HRV RMSSD 30 Sec Window - RMSSD calculated for consecutive 30 second intervals
  - HR from heartbeat - beat-to-beat interval converted to HR
- stress tracking
  - Stress - summary of the the average stress during the session
  - Average stress for the beginning and end of the session (calculated automatically by the watch for session of 5min or more)
  - HR Peaks 10 Sec Window
    - internal metric for calculating stress
    - tracks in overlapping 10 Sec Windows Max HR for each window
    - HR calculated from beat-to-beat interval
- respiration rate
  - Breathes per minute real time in watches that supports it (only works fine for Yoga activity due to bug in Connect IQ API for Breathing activity)
- configurable preparation time before the meditation session
- configurable finalization time after the meditation session
- summary stats at the end of the session
  - Heart rate chart including min, avg and max HR
  - Respiration rate chart including min, avg and max estimated respiration rate
  - Stress
  - HRV
- pause/resume current session using the back button
- ability to configure default custom activity name in Garmin Connect using Garmin Express in PC connected to the watch via USB cable
