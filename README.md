    - pNN20 - % of successive beat-to-beat intervals that differ by more than 20 ms
    - pNN50 - % of successive beat-to-beat intervals that differ by more than 50 ms
    - beat-to-beat interval - reading coming directly from the watch sensor
    - HRV Successive Differences - difference between the current and previous beat-to-beat intervals
    - SDRR - [Standard Deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of beat-to-beat intervals 
      - calculated from the first and last 5 min of the session
    - HRV RMSSD 30 Sec Window - RMSSD calculated for consecutive 30 second intervals    
    - HR from heartbeat - beat-to-beat interval converted to HR
- stress tracking
    - Stress - summary of the the average stress during the session 
    - Average stress for the beginning and end of the session (calculated automatically by the watch for session of 5min or more)
    - HR Peaks 10 Sec Window
      - internal metric for calculating stress 
      - tracks in overlapping 10 Sec Windows Max HR for each window 
      - HR calculated from beat-to-beat interval
- respiration rate
    - Breathes per minute real time in watches that supports it (only works fine for Yoga activity due to bug in Connect IQ API for Breathing activity)
- configurable preparation time before the meditation session
- summary stats at the end of the session
    - Heart rate chart including min, avg and max HR
    - Respiration rate chart including min, avg and max estimated respiration rate
    - Stress
    - HRV
- pause/resume current session using the back button
- ability to configure default custom activity name in Garmin Connect using Garmin Express in PC connected to the watch via USB cable
