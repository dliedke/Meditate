Meditation and breathwork are powerful practices that aim to enhance mental and physical well-being. Their common goals include reducing stress, increasing emotional balance, improving focus, and promoting self-awareness. While meditation emphasizes mindfulness and mental clarity, breathwork actively engages the nervous system through controlled breathing techniques to achieve relaxation, energy boosts, or emotional release.

Why Tracking Physiological Metrics Matters
Measuring stress levels, heart rate variability (HRV), and heart rate during meditation and breathwork provides valuable insights into their effectiveness.

* Stress Levels: Real-time stress tracking can help assess how meditation and breathwork reduce physiological tension over time.
* Heart Rate Variability (HRV): A higher HRV is linked to better autonomic nervous system balance, meaning improved resilience to stress. Slow, deep breathing and mindfulness practices can enhance HRV, reflecting better relaxation and recovery.
* Heart Rate: Meditation typically lowers heart rate over time, while breathwork may cause temporary fluctuations depending on the technique used. Tracking heart rate can reveal patterns in how the body responds to different practices.!

This meditation/yoga app is tracks all these metrics for you. This allows you to correlate biometric data with specific practices, helping to fine-tune your approach and track long-term progress.

Totally free application developed by vtrifonov and compiled/enhanced for newer Garmin watch models by dliedke and floriangeigl.

Full user guide (explains HRV metrics and how to use application in detail):
https://github.com/floriangeigl/Meditate/blob/main/UserGuide.md

Avoid moving your wrist during the session in order to capture HRV and Respiration rate metrics. If HRV is not being detected, please reboot your watch pressing light button for 15s, turn it on and retry the application.

Note: Connect IQ API used for application development only returns the 5min average for the stress metric. That's why the numbers don't match exactly with Garmin Connect, because in GC it shows the real time stress metric when activity started and stopped.

Troubleshooting guide:

Connect IQ! message in the watch:
-----------------------------------------------
Please use Garmin Express in PC with watch connected to USB to change activity name. If the app is no longer opening, please reinstall it. Unfortunately due to a bug with Connect IQ mobile it is not possible to change the activity name using configuration button.  

HRV not being detected:
---------------------------------
Sometimes HRV takes longer to be detected if you were moving before starting the application. Please stay quiet for sometime, not moving the wrist with the watch, then open the app and wait for HRV ready before starting your meditate session. If it doesn't work try holding light button for 15s then turn on watch again and retry the app to check if HRV is being detected. 

No vibration or sound during sessions:
---------------------------------------------------
Make sure to enable vibration in System - Sound and Vibe - Vibration (On). Also make sure to enable sound in System - Sound and Vibe - Alert Tones (On).
